Introduction
WARRIOR & WIZARD is, as the name implies, a game about people getting into fights wielding weapons or spells.  WARRIOR & WIZARD is somewhere between a roleplaying game and a board game, in that each player has a "playing piece" (here called a character) that represents, in some way, a person. 

WARRIOR & WIZARD uses six-sided dice.  You'll need at least three of them, perhaps as many as six or seven (but probably no more than that); these dice will be referred to in the text as "d6" for six-sided die.  Two dice will be referred to as 2d6, three dice as 3d6, and so on.  Bonuses or penalties to the dice roll are referred to as such; 2d6+1 means to roll two six-sided dice and add one to the total, while 3d6-2 means to roll three dice and subtract two.  (Other roleplaying games use dice with differing numbers of sides, and refer to those dice similarly; we use the notation here out of habit, even though d6 are the only die type we use in this game.) 

The game is suitable for two or more players, and can be played in three modes: player vs. player, player vs. player with a referee (here called a gamemaster or GM) or multiple players cooperating plus a GM.  In player vs. player, each player creates a character and fights it out; in a player vs. player with GM situation, the gamemaster controls the environment as well as any additional characters not run by the players (known as nonplayer characters or NPCs); these NPCs can include monsters, if present.  If playing cooperatively with multiple players and a GM, one or more players create a character, and one person acts as the gamemaster and creates adventures and NPCs, makes decisions based on tough calls where there might be a question about the interactions between character abilities and the rules, and the like.
