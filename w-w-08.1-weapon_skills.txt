Weapon Skills (Min. INT varies):
Weapon Familiarity: The character is familiar with a weapon, or type of weapon, and knows how to use it in combat at no penalty.  Attempting to use a weapon in combat without knowing how to use it incurs a -4 penalty on all rolls to hit; some weapons either can't be used unskilled or can potentially injure the unskilled user (this is noted in the weapon's description).  Costs and Minimum Intelligence scores for the various weapon groups are listed in the table below:

The cost of any of the "Common" groups is reduced if you have any of the component groups, by the cost of the component groups.   More information on weapons, including using them in combat, may be found in the Combat section.

Familiarity with a weapon also provides some effective Armoury skill when using that weapon; the character knows how to perform basic field maintenance and some extremely minor repairs.  Weapon Familiarity Cost:  See table.  Min. INT:  See table.
